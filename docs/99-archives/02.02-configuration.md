# Configuration

Grid services get their configuration from `/etc/gu`.

You can generate the configuration files by following the instructions [here](../scripts/generate-config/README.md).

Alternatively, if you work for the Guardian, you can run [`./fetch-config.sh`](../fetch-config.sh) to download the config for the shared stack we use in DEV.
